# grblHAL driver for Spark Project

ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

This is a fork of [grblHAL](https://github.com/grblHAL) (and [its customization for STM32H7xx series](https://github.com/dresco/STM32H7xx)), with necessary changes for [Spark](https://github.com/xy-kasumi/Spark).

It's very early stage and you won't find it useful yet.

Whether it'll diverge enough from grblHAL design or not is to be determined.
